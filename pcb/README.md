# PCB

These PCBs were provided by PCBWay in exchage for an honest review with the following settings:

- PCB color: Black
- Surface Finish: Immersion gold (ENIG)

## Notes:

- MCU component side faces away from the board on both sides.
- Mind the wire orientation when connecting the JST connector!

## Parts list:

- 2x JST connectors male & female ([AliExpress](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mrW9HoI))
- 2x battery
- splitkb.com:
  - 2x nice!nano v2 w/ low-profile sockets
  - 2x power switch
  - 30x Choc V1/MX switches
  - 30x Choc V1/MX keycaps
  - 60x Mill-Max hot swap sockets (type: 7305)
  - 2x tenting puck (optional)

I tried to only use parts that could be ordered from a single vendor but the JST connector from splitkb was just to big for my liking.
